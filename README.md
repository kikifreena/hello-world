Just another repository - for cs35

hi everyone! i'm just another college student interested in coding, hippos, and purple - i majored in psychology and asian american studies. Enjoy!

Here's a picture of a dingo that I took while I was studying abroad in Wellington, New Zealand:

In my free time, I like to:
* take pictures (see [my photography blog](http://kikifreena.tumblr.com/])!)
* look at hippos
* knit
* draw
* write!
* play pokemon go like a true nerd
* sing along to my newest favorite song like no one's in the room... shhh....
